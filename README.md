# AsyncJS-mockServer - the power of the callback revealed

Quick example of how asyncornicity in javascript behaves throught timers. 

Built a mock get and post request that leverages a hard coded data array which simulates a collection stored in some database.
We loop through the response and build out a list on the Client side. 


Example 1: Simple Timer based mock responses. 

Example 2: Callbacks implemented into the calls to controll the flow.
